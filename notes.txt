* root, view and sheet come from the current SCREEN if one exists,
  otherwise from GAME. but watch out for GAME-INIT :BEFORE (GAME)
  which calls GAME-VIEW, so the screen has to be set before that
  (e.g. in a specialized GAME-INIT :BEFORE method)

* fix make-instance 'sprite -- add to root should be explicit
  interface

* fix accessor names -- GAME-ROOT for SCREEN?!
